# Random-Poem-Generator

Generates a random haiku type poem and shows it in a pop-up screen using Tkinter. It uses pre-determined grammar rules and chooses the appropriate word types randomly. 
The end goal of this proejct is to create a webpage with options for different poem types. 
The code is rather messy now but I will be organizing it in a more structured way while implementing it as a webpage.
