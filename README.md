# Random Poem Generator
Generates a random haiku poem. Randomly selectes between several possible sentence structures, and fills in the sentence with the appropriate parts of speeches by randomly selecting them from several txt files.

Inspired by the randomness theme, the web-app also generates a new random pastel color with each poem. The randomly generated pastel color constitutes the background of the poem and its complementary color constitutes the background of the whole page.

Alternatively, you can run the web-app locally. First install all packages in requirements.txt. Then, type "python app.py" to run the flask app. Open a browser and navigate to your http://localhost:5000.
